| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Specification Conformity | - Are the requirements clearly defined?<br>- Does the code meet the given specification?                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Error Handling           | - Are failure cases from external APIs properly handled?<br>- Are appropriate fallback actions implemented? |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Edge Case Handling       | - Are special cases like empty inputs or maximum values considered?                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Impact on Other Features | - Could this change unintentionally affect other features?                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Type Safety              | - Are type mismatches avoided (especially in dynamically typed languages)?                                  | e.g., Comparing an `int` with a `string` in Python can cause false negatives even if the values seem equal.                                                                                                              |

| Security                 | - Is input validation properly implemented (e.g., preventing SQL injection, XSS)?                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Mocking Appropriateness     | - Is mocking limited to external services or time-related logic?<br>- Is the mocking scope appropriate? | Too much mocking can lead to unrepresentative tests. Aim to execute as much real code as possible. |
| Edge Case Coverage          | - Are edge cases (e.g., zero records, max values) properly tested?                                      |                                                                                                    |

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance                 | - Is memory and computational efficiency acceptable?<br>- Are SQL queries optimized for performance? | e.g., Consider use of indexes, partitioning, clustering, etc.                |

| Infrastructure Requirements | - Are all necessary runtime conditions and environments in place?                                    | e.g., Required packages installed? Network access to new services available? |
| Cloud Quota Constraints     | - Are API rate limits and usage quotas properly accounted for?                                       |                                                                              |
